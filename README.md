## How Coinomize Bitcoin Mixer Service Works

Coinomize uses a layered privacy process to improve anonymity:

1. **Start Mixing**  
   Users begin by generating a unique deposit address for their Bitcoin transaction. This address is unlinked from personal information.

2. **Coin Pooling and Fragmentation**  
   Incoming Bitcoin is broken into randomized fragments and mixed with other users’ coins to ensure unlinkability.

3. **Privacy Routing**  
   These fragments follow multiple unpredictable paths before redistribution, enhancing privacy and thwarting blockchain tracing methods.

4. **Delayed & Secure Redistribution**  
   After a configurable time delay, the mixed coins are redistributed to user‑specified addresses in a manner designed to maximize privacy.

By combining **CoinJoin‑like techniques** with fragmentation and controlled timing, Coinomize helps make transaction flows difficult to trace.
